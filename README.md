## Understanding the Codes/Signum

Rundata uses Codes they call Signum to identify runic enscriptions, these have a certain logic to them

Sometimes the codes can contain the following meaningful signs:

|Sign|Meaning|
|---|---|
|â€ |The inscription has disappeared|
|$|New reading or interpretation that has been supplemented from another source|
|M|The inscription is medeival|
|U|The inscription is in Old Norse|
|No M or U| The inscription is Viking age|
